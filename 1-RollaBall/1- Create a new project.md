## 1. Create a new project
To create an interactive game or project. We need to select a URP template for rendering. Although either 2D or 3D is ok, for this biginning project, we will 1. select the  `3D(URP)` template 2. Self-define the project name 3. Click `Create project` button to open the project in the editor

``` ad-important
The newest 3.4.1 Unity Hub splits the original URP template into 2D and 3D templates. To realize a mobile 3D interactive rendering as the official tutorial shows, please select the 3D(URP), from my hindsight....
